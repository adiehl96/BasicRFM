## Original Code
The code in the main branch is cleaned, with any superfluous code removed. The full original code can be downloaded from the [website](https://jamesrobertlloyd.com/assets/BasicRFM.tar.gz) of the first author or from [github](https://github.com/adiehl96/BasicRFM/files/8727738/BasicRFM.tar.gz). Alternatively, it can be viewed on the branch [original](https://github.com/adiehl96/BasicRFM/tree/original). The only changes done on the original branch are the following:
* Added .gitignore files to the directories `DataFolds` and `PartialResults`. These are empty directories that hold temporary files, which are needed to run the code.
