## Original Code
The code in the main branch is cleaned, with any superfluous code removed. The full original code can be found on the branch [original](https://github.com/adiehl96/BasicRFM/tree/original). The only changes done on the original branch are the following:
* Added .gitignore files to the directories `DataFolds` and `PartialResults`. These are empty directories that hold temporary files, which are needed to run the code.
